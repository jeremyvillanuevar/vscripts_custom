// TUTORIAL_STANDARDS_VS

// Every map has been modified with care. Tutorial Standards VS offers a brief
// opportunity to explain the standards applied to every map to improve Versus.
// When this map is loaded, use "ShowUpdate()" to visualize these changes.

// Firstly, some func_playerinfected_clips only serve to inconvenience Hunters.
// These clips are uniquely identified using their "Radius" NetProp as a checksum
// of their vecMins and vecMaxs.

// If a rooftop is clipped in this way, it generally meant Valve determined
// the attack to be too overpowered for all SI; but forgot that Hunters are
// entitled to a bit extra freedom. A lot of maps Kill these clips and add new
// ladders to open them up for all SI, but for this map we're taking a hint
// that it's imbalanced and opening these to Hunter/Jockey only. Deleting clips
// to allow players to touch the SKYBOX is generally discouraged, so both these
// deletions have full freedom of movement around them. Note that Hunters can
// pounce off SKYBOX but not these func_playerinfected_clip, thus in cases they
// are allowed such access the SKYBOX should be shielded with make_clip().

kill_funcinfclip( 334.621 );	// Delete clip on low roof immediately out of safe room
kill_funcinfclip( 408.18 );	// Delete useless clip over a fence most SI can't even touch

// Both the below clips belong to the same rooftop. Even though not necessarily
// the case with Tutorial Standards because it's small, some maps benefit from
// opening up rooftops with existing props to act as LOS blockers -- sometimes
// these are non-solid and require a make_prop() to solidify them, but here we're
// lucky and the AC vent is already solid.

kill_funcinfclip( 320.18 );	// Delete 1st clip above backyard's lower roof
kill_funcinfclip( 328.248 );	// Delete 2nd clip above backyard's lower roof

// Now we can add a new ladder to allow all SI players onto this roof. It's always
// best to clone an existing ladder that's already facing in the desired direction,
// but in this case the one nearby is too tall and would stick through the ceiling
// so we're using an alternative that has the exact height but requires rotation.
// The below code specifies the "m_vecSpecifiedSurroundingMaxs" (or VSSM) of the
// clone target, then the offset Origin and Angles from the original's location,
// followed by its new Normal (aka Forward Vector).

make_ladder( "_ladder_acvent_cloned_smallest", "-342 -336 328", "-1114 549 0", "0 90 0", "0 1 0" );

// some explanation for the new void they're able to see and touch.

// This backyard still has problems. There's 4 ladders on the outside of the fence
// but no ladders for players to actually get out there to spawn or attack from.
// Given that all 4 ladders are next to each other, it's only necessary to flip 1
// then the same data can be used for each where only the VSSM needs changing.
// Note that 4 ladders is only for demonstration purposes where normally in these
// cases just 1 new ladder is OK -- too many ladders is equally bad as too few.

// Finally this backyard has a tree cluster back here SI players can permanently
// get stuck in. This adds a clip, completing the area. The higher rooftop back
// here is ignored because it's part of a large contiguous rooftop split by SKYBOX.
// While the higher rooftop could be salvaged because the SKYBOX isn't that bad,
// there's rooftops of competitive height nearby and the benefit is small as it's
// outside the finale event area.

// Now let's add a new ladder that's purely Quality-of-Life (QoL). At the top
// of the elevator there's only a ladder on the right side and not the left.
// The one on the right has already established the precedent for using pipe
// models to justify the climb to Survivors. It's also in the Survivor's critical
// path and is given clips on both sides known as "ladder guides". QoL ladders
// get SI players to the attacks they want to make quicker.

// Last but not least, there's an exploit where Survivors are able to bash the
// subway car door to get inside early. DoEntFire() is used to modify the unnamed
// prop_dynamic to require a minimum of 4 damage to injure it at all -- it starts
// at 200 health and each bash does 3 damage. This map has no melee weapon spawns.
